Today I got a bus to the capital of Minas Gerais sate, called Belo Horizonte, to meet with my uncle Hugo Saporetti Junior at his home on an apartment at the center of the city.

I just came here to start a new journey for my life: **the journey of the new development master**. lol. To do this amazing job I need a good teacher, so my generous uncle decided to help me on this quest. I'm so greatfull for that. 

The course started quicker than I was specting.

	* Made my Dropbox account to share files and works
	* Downloaded Ubuntu for my learns on Linux development
	* Created GitHub account to version my development environment and learn how to code
