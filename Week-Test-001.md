Create a calculator following the requirements below:

#### Allowed operations:

    * Sum (+)
    * Subtraction (-)
    * Division (/)
    * Multiplication (*)
    * Square Root (@)
    * Power Of (^)

#### Visualisation:

There must have a menu like the following:

**to exit press [ctrl+c]
================================
Operations: + - / * @ ^
--------------------------------
 Left operand [0]:

#### Requirements:

    2. The app should handle pressing letters instead of numbers for operands.
    3. The app should handle invalid operations not in ['+','-','/','*','@','^'].
    4. The app should handle invalid operation like N/0 (division by zero).
